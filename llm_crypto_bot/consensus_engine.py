Multi-Agent Consensus Engine for Crypto Trading Bot

This module orchestrates a sophisticated debate between multiple LLM models
to arrive at robust trading decisions through a three-step process:
1. Analyst: Summarizes raw data into structured market brief
2. Debate: Bullish agent vs Cautious agent present opposing viewpoints  
3. Strategist: Makes final consensus decision based on all arguments

TRADING PHILOSOPHY:
- We trade to PROFIT, not just to preserve capital
- Strong bullish signals with good fundamentals should trigger BUY decisions
- Only HOLD when signals are genuinely mixed or unclear
- Risk is managed through position sizing, not avoiding all trades
- Confidence should reflect the strength of signals, not fear of losses

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the primary asset being discussed (e.g., BTC, ETH, MATIC, SOL) in the analysis
2. Your final 'action' must be for that specific asset
3. If multiple strong bullish signals align, lean toward BUY with high confidence
4. If no specific asset can be identified from the data, the action must be HOLD
5. The 'token' field must contain the primary asset symbol (e.g., "BTC", "ETH", "MATIC")
