CRYPTO TRADING BOT - ERROR LOG
===============================

CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED:

1. INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR GAS:
   - SOL Trade: "insufficient funds for gas * price + value: balance 0, tx cost 10000000000000"
   - AVNT Trade: "insufficient funds for gas * price + value: have 0 want 474687100000"
   - ROOT CAUSE: Wallet has 0 native token (BNB/ETH) for gas fees

2. REAL TRADES FALLING BACK TO SIMULATED:
   - All real DEX attempts fail â†’ fallback to simulated success
   - Position tracking records simulated trades as real
   - Bot thinks it's learning from real trades but isn't

3. POSITION MANAGEMENT ERRORS:
   - Selling MATIC with -100% loss (likely from simulated data)
   - No actual positions to manage since no real trades executed

4. MISSING EXECUTION PRICE:
   - Error: "Trade execution failed: 'execution_price'"
   - Fallback system creates trade but missing key data fields

5. TOKEN DISCOVERY INCONSISTENCIES:
   - SOL found on BSC but real SOL should be native Solana
   - Using wrapped/bridge tokens instead of proper tokens

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:
- Fund wallet with native tokens for gas (BNB for BSC, ETH for Ethereum, etc.)
- Remove fallback simulation system for production
- Fix real DEX execution to actually transact
- Ensure proper token contract addresses
- Add gas balance checking before trade attempts

WALLET STATUS:
- Current Balance: $52.64 (but no gas tokens)
- Needs: BNB for BSC trades, ETH for Ethereum trades
- Recommendation: Add $10-20 in native tokens for gas fees
